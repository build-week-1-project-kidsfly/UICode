Kidsfly is a company that works with parents and airports to satisfy parents flying with kids. 
What we do is allow parents to sign up to our website and let airports know when they will be arriving. 
What this does is allow airport staff that also use our services to be notified within five minutes of the family arriving.
This alert sends someone, or multiple people depending on the number of kids, to accomodate the parents by taking their luggage while the parents watch over their kids. 
Parents have enough stress to deal with in every day life. 
Here at Kidsfly, we try to make it easier for parent's lives by making their flights stress free.
